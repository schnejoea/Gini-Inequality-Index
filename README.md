# Gini-Inequality-Index
This tool was used to familiarize members of Cal Poly SLO's Economics Society with ways to measure inequality. 
The R Markdown file includes a function that graphs a Lorenz curve and returns different measures of inequality when passed a dataframe containing information on cookware ownership among Economics Society members. These measure include the Gini coefficient, 90/50 ratio, and 80/20 ratio.
